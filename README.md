a2img

The idea here is to convert any file in to an image.

To use:
a2img [options] file-to-convert-to-image image-name

If you just give one argument a2img will create a file with the same name but
with the extension of the image type appended to it. For example,

a2img myfile.txt

will create a file called
myfile.txt.ppm
